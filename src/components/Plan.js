import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Plan extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render() {
        return (

                <p>
                    The plan is to remember how to use reactJS. It's been a little less than a year since I've used it and it's a querky little thing. React uses two types of components. A functional and stateless component. I like to think of it as static vs dynamic. Forinstance the date today is:
                </p>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
export default Plan;
